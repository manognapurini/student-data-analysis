# Student Performance Data Analysis

## 📖 Project Overview
This project analyzes student performance data to identify factors influencing academic outcomes.  
Using Python-based data analysis techniques, the project explores patterns, relationships, and trends within the dataset through statistical analysis and visualization.

The objective is to demonstrate practical skills in data cleaning, exploration, and insight generation using real-world structured data.

---

##  Objectives
- Load and explore student performance data
- Perform data quality checks and preprocessing
- Analyze descriptive statistics
- Identify relationships between variables
- Visualize key academic trends

---

##  Dataset Information
- **Type:** Student academic performance data
- **Format:** CSV
- **Content Includes:**
